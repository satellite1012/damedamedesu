** Website Structure **
***********************

- No authentication needed
Main page - quick description and links to login and registration
Login page
Registration page
    - right now just simple user/password

- Authentication needed
Home page - summary page with links to other pages, notifications
    - notify when user's turn is active or when user has no more songs in pool for user whose turn it is
My Songs page - manage song links
    - each song has fields name, link, user(s) suggested to
        - can set one or more other group members for each link
    - includes songs that were gifted previously, up to 600 total between existing and old songs
Group page
    - if turn in progress, person whose turn it is can rate/rank each song and hit finish when done with turn
        - when turn is over, who suggested which song is revealed and all players see the rankings
    - if turn not in progress, previous turn's results still show, and someone can hit button to start next turn (perhaps have majority rule on button?)
